#### Biryani
Biryani, in itself, is a complete delicacy. The second reason for liking is the awesome mix of the flavors of Basmati rice with selected spices. This simply takes it to a completely new level. Next is the type of cooking style used, that is , the “Dum” effect. What happens is that the most authentic way to make biryani is by mixing all the spices and sealing it for more than 5–6 hours on a slow fire, which renders its cooking it its own juices. 

**Never Compromise**

# CODE FENCING

HyperTalk is a discontinued high-level, procedural programming language created in 1987 by Dan Winkler and used in conjunction with Apple Computer's HyperCard hypermedia program by Bill Atkinson. Because the main target audience of HyperTalk was beginning programmers, HyperTalk programmers were usually called "authors" and the process of writing programs was known as "scripting". HyperTalk scripts resembled written English and used a logical structure similar to that of the Pascal programming language.
